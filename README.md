Hi all!

Codaisseurify is an assignment that I got during my studies at Codaisseur Academy.

Codaisseurify is a sort Spotify with options to listen to music and CRUD functionalities with Artists, Albums and Songs.

Things you may want to cover:

Please make sure that this version does not have a functioning favorite list, it'll me be fixed in the future.
I'm really sorry for that.

Before running the app make sure you sign in and then log-in to enjoy all of the functionalities.
after signing in an "all music" button will appear at the drop down menu at the upper right side.

Different Home screens are being generated if you're logged in or come as a guest.

In the future when logged-in you will have the option to add songs to your own favorite list.

URL of the songs must be from SoundCloud so it can work, please take that in consideration.


Steve
