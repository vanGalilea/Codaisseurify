Hi all!

Codaisseurify is an assignment that I got during my studies at Codaisseur Academy.

Codaisseurify is a sort Spotify with options to listen to music and CRUD functionalities with Artists, Albums and Songs.


Link to the deployed app: https://limitless-retreat-83843.herokuapp.com/

IMPORTANT:

Before running the app make sure you sign in and then log-in to enjoy all of the functionalities!

After signing in an "all music" button will appear at the drop down menu at the upper right side and at the home page.

Different Home screens are being generated if you're logged in or come as a guest.

When logged-in you have the option to add songs to your own favorite list.

URL of the songs must be from SoundCloud so it can work, please take that in consideration.

Keys meaning :

in Fav. list: X - remove from my fav. list

in Artists: note sign- show artist page, pencil - edit artist page, X- remove artist and it's content (albums and songs)

Same thing in Albums.

in Songs: same thing V- add to my fav. list


have a nice day,  

  Steve
